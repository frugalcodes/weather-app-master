<!-- OVERVIEW -->

## Overview

while making this app I learn how to work with API and how to access data from other websites that are normally forbidden by the [same-origin policy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Same-origin_policy) of web browsers

Following things you can do on this web app:

- You can see your current location weather by default
- You can search for the weather by city name
- You can see the weather of today and the next 5 days
- You can see the date and location of the weather
- you can see according to the image for each type of weather and see the min and max degree each day
- you can see wind status and wind direction
- You can see humidity percentage and also you can see a visibility indicator
- You can see the air pressure number
- You can request your current location weather
